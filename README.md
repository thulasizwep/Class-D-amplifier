# Class-D-amplifier
1️⃣ Background Theory
A Class D amplifier is a switching amplifier that uses pulse-width modulation (PWM) or similar techniques (e.g., pulse-density modulation, sigma-delta modulation) to represent an analog audio signal as a sequence of high-frequency pulses.

Instead of linearly amplifying the audio waveform (as in Class A or B), it switches the output transistors fully on or fully off. This drastically reduces the time they spend in the linear conduction region, minimizing power loss.

Because of this switching nature:

Power efficiency can exceed 90%

Heat generation is low, even at high output power

Compact size is achievable (no huge heatsinks)

2️⃣ Working Principle
Step-by-step signal flow:

Modulation Stage

The incoming audio signal is compared with a high-frequency carrier wave (typically a triangular or sawtooth waveform).

The comparator output is a PWM signal where duty cycle is proportional to the instantaneous amplitude of the audio signal.

Switching Output Stage

This PWM drives MOSFETs (or other transistors) in a half-bridge or full-bridge configuration.

MOSFETs operate as switches, drastically reducing conduction and switching losses compared to analog amplification.

Low-Pass Filtering

The amplified PWM signal passes through an LC low-pass filter.

This removes the high-frequency carrier, leaving only the amplified audio signal.

Load (Speaker)

The clean audio drives the loudspeaker at the desired power level.

Illustrative Example
Imagine:

Carrier frequency: 250 kHz

Audio: 1 kHz sine wave
The PWM signal’s duty cycle varies slowly over time to match the 1 kHz waveform. After filtering, only the 1 kHz sine remains — but now it’s strong enough to drive a speaker.
